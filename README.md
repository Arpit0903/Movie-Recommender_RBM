# Movie-Recommender_RBM
A movie recommender which uses Restricted Boltzmann Machines to predict whether a movie will be liked by a person or not.

A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs.

Restricted Boltzmann machines can also be used in deep learning networks. In particular, deep belief networks can be formed by "stacking" RBMs and optionally fine-tuning the resulting deep network with gradient descent and backpropagation.

Sampling in an RBM
Samples of a joint distribution can be obtained by running a Markov chain to convergence, using Gibbs sampling as the transition operator.
